# LAY-OFF-ANALYTICS

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a layoffs dataset using various data analysis tools. We have created a Google Colab report, a Streamlit app, and a Power BI dashboard to provide different perspectives and interactive visualizations of the data.

Table of Contents Introduction Dataset Google Colab Report Streamlit App Power BI Dashboard How to Run Conclusion License Introduction The purpose of this project is to analyze the layoffs dataset to gain insights into the patterns and trends of layoffs across different companies, industries, and countries. By using multiple tools, we aim to provide a comprehensive and interactive analysis that can be easily accessed and interpreted.

Dataset The dataset used in this analysis contains information about layoffs, including:

Company name Date of the layoff Location and country Industry Number of employees laid off Percentage of employees laid off Company stage Funds raised Google Colab Report The Google Colab report contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the layoffs dataset. The report includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover trends and patterns.

Google Colab Report Features Data cleaning and preprocessing Summary statistics Missing values analysis Distribution of numerical and categorical features Correlation analysis Time series analysis Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn Streamlit App The Streamlit app provides an interactive way to explore the layoffs dataset. Users can select different types of analyses from a sidebar and visualize the results dynamically.

Streamlit App Features Basic information and summary statistics Missing values analysis Distribution of numerical features Correlation matrix Time series plots Scatter plot matrix Categorical feature analysis Boxplots by country and industry Trend analysis over time Top companies, industries, and countries by layoffs Layoffs percentage analysis Funds raised analysis Interactive visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib Power BI Dashboard The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and visually appealing way to explore the layoffs dataset. It includes various charts and graphs that help in understanding the data more intuitively.
